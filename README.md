**Platform for Situated Intelligence** (or in short, \\psi, pronounced like the greek letter) is an open, extensible framework for development and research of multimodal, integrative-AI systems. Examples include multimodal interactive systems such as social robots and embodied conversational agents, systems for ambient intelligence and smart spaces, applications based on small devices that work with streaming sensor data, etc. In essence, any application that processes streaming, sensor data (such as audio, video, depth, etc.), combines multiple (AI) technologies, and operates under latency constraints can benefit from the affordances the provided by the framework.

The framework accelerates the development of these applications by providing: 
-	a modern, performant **infrastructure** for working with multimodal, temporally streaming data
-	a set of **tools** for multimodal data visualization, annotation, and processing
-	an ecosystem of **components** for various sensors, processing technologies, and effectors

A high-level overview of the framework is available in [this blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/platform-for-situated-intelligence-an-open-source-framework-for-multimodal-integrative-ai/).

# Whatâ€™s New

__09/02/2020__: We published [a blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/platform-for-situated-intelligence-an-open-source-framework-for-multimodal-integrative-ai/) with a high-level overview of the framework.

__08/31/2020__: We released version [0.13.38.2]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/releases/tag/v0.13.38.2-beta), which brings important updates to Platform for Situated Intelligence Studio (including data annotation), updates to the runtime to support 3rd party data store sources, and components for running ONNX models. See the [release notes]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Release-Notes#20200831-beta-release-version-013382) for a more complete description of updates.

# Getting Started

The core \\psi infrastructure is built on .NET Standard and therefore runs both on Windows and Linux. Some [components](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/List-of-Components) and tools are more specific and are available only on one or the other operating system. You can build \\psi applications either by [leveraging \\psi NuGet packages](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Using-via-NuGet-Packages), or by [cloning and building the source code](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Building-the-Codebase). 

__A Quick Introduction.__ To learn more about \\psi and how to build applications with it, we recommend you start with the [Brief Introduction](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Brief-Introduction) tutorial, which will walk you through for some of the main concepts. It shows how to create a simple program, describes the core concept of a stream, and explains how to transform, synchronize, visualize, persist and replay streams from disk.

__Samples.__ A number of small [sample applications](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Samples), several with walkthroughs, are also available. A good starting point is a sample ([Windows version](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi-samples/tree/main/Samples/WebcamWithAudioSample) or [Linux version](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi-samples/tree/main/Samples/LinuxWebcamWithAudioSample)) that illustrates how to capture and process synchronized data from a webcam and microphone.

__Documentation.__ The documentation for \\psi is available in the [github project wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki). It contains many additional resources, including [tutorials]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Tutorials), other [specialized topics]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Other-Topics), and a full [API reference](https://microsoft.github.io/psi/api/Microsoft.Psi.html) that can help you learn more about the framework.
